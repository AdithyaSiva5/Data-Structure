## Further Learning

### Competitive Coding Problems:
Below are some example problems for each data structure:

#### Trees:
1. Given a binary tree, determine if it is a valid binary search tree (BST).
2. Find the diameter of a binary tree (the length of the longest path between any two nodes).
3. Given two binary trees, check if they are identical.

#### Binary Search Trees (BST):
1. Find the kth smallest element in a BST.
2. Convert a binary search tree to a sorted doubly linked list.
3. Given a binary search tree, find the lowest common ancestor (LCA) of two given nodes.

#### Heap:
1. Merge k sorted arrays into one sorted array using a min heap.
2. Find the kth largest element in an array using a max heap.
3. Given a list of jobs with their start and end times, schedule the jobs to minimize the maximum number of machines required.

#### Heap Sort:
1. Implement the heap sort algorithm to sort an array of integers.
2. Find the median of a stream of integers using two heaps.
3. Given an array of meeting intervals, find the minimum number of conference rooms required.

#### Trie:
1. Implement an autocomplete system using a trie.
2. Given a list of words, find all words that are concatenation of two words from the list.
3. Implement a spell checker using a trie.

#### Graph:
1. Given a directed graph, check if it contains a cycle.
2. Find the shortest path between two nodes in an unweighted graph using BFS.
3. Given a list of tasks with their dependencies, schedule the tasks in the correct order.

#### Graph Traversals (BFS, DFS):
1. Given an undirected graph, find all connected components.
2. Given a grid representing a maze, find the shortest path from start to end using BFS.
3. Check if a given graph is bipartite (can be colored with only two colors) using BFS or DFS.
